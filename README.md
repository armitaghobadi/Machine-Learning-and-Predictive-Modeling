# Machine-Learning-and-Predictive-Modeling
I contributed to various projects across different industries, including real estate, automotive, and manufacturing. In these projects, I developed predictive models to estimate housing prices, used car values, and construction costs for townhouses in specific ZIP codes. Additional details are available for each project.
